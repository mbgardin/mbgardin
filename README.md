# Hi, I’m Monte 👋

I am an undergraduate Statistics and Data Science major at Brigham Young University with a strong interest in applied analytics, statistical modeling, and machine learning. I enjoy working at the intersection of technical rigor and real-world impact, particularly on projects that translate data into clear, actionable insights.

My academic interests are shaped by both quantitative problem-solving and a broader curiosity about how data informs human systems. Alongside my statistics coursework, I have pursued projects in areas such as fraud detection, dynamic pricing, and automation, with an emphasis on building end-to-end solutions rather than isolated models. I am especially interested in applications that connect data science with business decision-making and operational efficiency. Many of these project have had real world application through my current position with BYU OIT.

Originally from Mesa, Arizona, I value structured thinking, steady progress, and collaboration. I enjoy learning new tools, refining my technical skill set, and working with others who care about building things that are both thoughtful and useful. I also am a big fan of music and classical voice.
